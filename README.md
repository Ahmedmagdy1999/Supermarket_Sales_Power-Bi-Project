# Supermarket_Sales_Report

## Overview
This project analyzes Supermarket Sales Data using Power BI to uncover key insights and answer important business questions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and the analysis includes data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to provide meaningful insights about sales performance, customer trends, and product profitability.

## Data Source
 Dataset Name: Supermarket Sales

 Source: Kaggle (Public Dataset)

 Description: The dataset contains sales transactions from a supermarket, including details like product categories, payment methods, customer types, and purchase amounts.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepped using Power Query in Power BI. The key steps included:

1. Understanding the Data: Reviewed the dataset to identify missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formatting.
2. Column Header Modification: Renamed column headers to be more readable and structured.
3. Duplicate Removal: Eliminated duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy and consistency.


## Data Analysis & Visualizations

Interactive visualizations were created using Power BI to answer key business questions.

### Most Profitable Branch
